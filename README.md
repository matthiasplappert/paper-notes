## Rendering equations
Unfortunately, Github does not support rendering Latex math expressions out of the box.
However, there's a simple [Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-with-mathjax/ioemnmodlmafdkllaclgeombjnmnbima) that will use MathJax to render math locally.
After installing, the following equation should be render properly:
$$a^2+b^2=c^2$$
